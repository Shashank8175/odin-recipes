    <h1>Simple Macaroni and Cheese</h1>

    <p>Quick, easy, and tasty macaroni and cheese
        dish. Fancy, designer mac and cheese often
        costs forty or fifty dollars to prepare when
        you have so many exotic and expensive
        cheeses, but they aren't always the best
        tasting. This simple recipe is cheap and tasty.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow
            macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked
            through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
            Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5
            minutes. Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously.
            Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling,
            about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</p></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and
        burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if
        overcooked.</p>
